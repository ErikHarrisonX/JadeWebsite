  <ul>
    <li class="title">Volunteer Nurse Assistant, U of U hospital, 2015 - 2018</li>
    <p id="Nurse">During this time, my dad got into a freak mountain bike accident which made him paralyzed from the neck down. My family and I then took it upon ourselves to take care of him during this time, I then had to learn how to perform nursing activities. The nursing activities included, how to operate a ventilator, know how to use a cough assist machine, and how to complete basic nursing needs like bathroom procedures and bed procedures. Also during while doing this I worked a lot with the Respiratory Therapist, and he said that I had the qualifications to become a Respiratory Therapist. Another thing, during this it helped me learn about, the healthcare of this country, group work and moral, and how to adapt to tight schedules. With my family and I we took care of my father for his last 3 years (RIP). However, because of this it has opened my eyes on what part of a work force is like, specifically nursing and how bad this country's healthcare truly is. My family and I also got used to taking shifts that would go into the dead of the night to take care of my dad.</p>
    <li class="title">Cashier at the Habit Burger Grill, Salt Lake city Utah, November 2018 - April 2019</li>
    <p>My position at the Habit was Cashier and busboy. I learned to work with a great team and learned very quickly how to do things. It helped me build up my social skills and helped me schedule out my stuff. Also while working here,  it made me really happy and I absolutely enjoyed every part of it! However, I feel like I could do something more with my life and time so I quit and decided to go back to college to get my bachelors degree in Science and Technology.</p>
    <li class="title">Security Programmer GRAB THE AXE (INTERNSHIP)– TEMPE, AZ, AUGUST 2022 TO JANUARY 2023</li>
    <p>This was an volunteer internship that I did to get my bachelor’s degree in science. I worked with a great team, we kept busy, we kept focus too. We worked on a programming project that involved some machine learning. We didn’t have enough programmers in the team, so it was just me and one other, but we did manage to get a good WIP of the program for Grab the Axe. During this it taught me how intusive tkinter for Python can be and how much I need to learn. It did make me learn quite a bit of cyber security programming.</p>

  <h2 id="lifestuff">ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2>
  <p>Some other accomplishments that I have done that are not related to school or work are things like volunteering work, playing at violin recitals. Things that stand out for me is me volunteering to help out with the Pride car parade for the Utah Pride, this was really great cause I had to manage many people to make sure they knew the route they needed to take and where they exit once they were finished. I was also with many others whom were also volunteering, and it was fun helping and talking with them. I think that everyone should have to manage traffic for a festival at least once in their life. Oh and the other volunteers had to do design work for the walls, gates, and areas so it was really nice to look at. I managed to take quite a bunch of pictures and videos of that. If you are interested in seeing those go look at my Youtube </br> I have also helped out with donating to charities and the utah food bank. I have actually helped giving out food to those in need during a school field trip to the food bank during gradeschool in 5th grade. I also donated to charities such as the Trevor Project, the Red Nose day Charity, and many others.</br> All the things that I have accomplished has given me a sense of accomplishment with helping out others that are in need. For instance, if I see a person who has a car broke down on the side of the freeway, I will go out of my way to help them. After all my motto is: "Be kind to one another after all, theres enough hate in this world as it is."
